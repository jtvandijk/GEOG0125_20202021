# Welcome {-}

Welcome to **Advanced Topics in Social and Geographic Data Science**, one of the elective modules for the MSc in Geographic and Social Data Science here at [UCL Geography](https://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/).This module has been designed as an advanced topics module to learn data science concepts and methods and to apply them in the domains of social science and geography. 

The first half of the module introduces a variety of important concepts such as statistical inference, deep learning, and convolutional neural networks. We will end with a keynote lecture from Carto on Spatial Data Science. In the second half of the module, we will introduce you to the practical skills of being a data scientists including an introduction to databases, unix-tools and web visualisation (a data sciencist's toolbox). We hope this module can provide you with the necessary knowledge in becoming a social and geographic data scientist in the future.
